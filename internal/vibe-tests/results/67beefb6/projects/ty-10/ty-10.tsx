      <Text as="p">Design systems have become the foundation of modern web development. They provide a shared language between designers and developers, ensuring consistency across products.</Text>
      <Text as="p">At their core, design systems are collections of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled to build applications.</Text>
      <Heading level={2}>The Evolution of Component Architecture</Heading>
      <Text as="p">The shift from monolithic CSS frameworks to modular component systems reflects a broader trend toward composability and reuse.</Text>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-800 pl-6 my-8 italic">
        <Text type="large">A good design system is invisible. It disappears into the product, letting content take center stage.</Text>
      </blockquote>
      <Text as="p">Component-driven development encourages teams to think in terms of building blocks rather than pages.</Text>
      <Heading level={2}>Accessibility as a Foundation</Heading>
      <Text as="p">When accessibility is built into the design system, every product inherits those guarantees. Focus management, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation come for free.</Text>
      <Heading level={2}>Looking Ahead</Heading>
      <Text as="p">The next wave of design systems will incorporate AI-assisted development, dynamic theming, and cross-platform consistency.</Text>
